## Why Format Buddy?

In many professional settings, maintaining a consistent file naming format is crucial. However, manually typing out these formats can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Format Buddy addresses this issue by automating the generation of these text formats, ensuring accuracy and saving valuable time.

By using Format Buddy, your workflow can benefit in the following ways:

- **Efficiency**: Save time by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniformity across all your file names and documents.
- **Accuracy**: Reduce the risk of human error in text formatting.

## How It Works

Format Buddy generates a dynamic text format based on user-provided initials and the current date. Here's a quick overview of the process:

1. **Enter Initials**: Users input their initials into the text field.
2. **Generate Text**: Click the "Generate and Copy" button.
3. **Copy to Clipboard**: The formatted text is generated and copied to the clipboard automatically.

The default format is `_INITIALS_DD-MMM-YYYY_V1`, where `INITIALS` is the user's input, `DD-MMM-YYYY` is the current date, and `V1` is the version number.

## Getting Started

To use Format Buddy, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter your initials in the input field.
3. Click the "Generate and Copy" button.
4. The generated text will be copied to your clipboard for easy pasting.

### Example

If the user's initials are `AD` and today's date is July 11, 2024, the generated text will be `_AD_11-JUL-2024_V1`.
